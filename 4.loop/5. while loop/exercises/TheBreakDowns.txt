  }

  return true;
}

...................................................................................

In this solution, we have an array called numbers that contains a list of numbers.
The count variable is initialized to 0 and serves as a counter to keep track of the 
number of prime numbers found.

The index variable is initialized to 0 and serves as an iterator to traverse the 
numbers array. The while loop runs as long as the count is less than 3 (to find 
three prime numbers) and the index is within the bounds of the numbers array.

Within the loop, we access the current number from the numbers array using the 
index variable.

We then call the isPrime function to check if the current number is prime. 
If it is, we print it using console.log(currentNumber) and increment the count 
variable.

After each iteration, the index variable is incremented by 1.
The loop continues until we find three prime numbers or we reach the end 
of the numbers array.

............................................................................
The isPrime function is the same as the one explained in a previous response. 
It checks if a given number is prime.

1. The isPrime function takes a number as an argument.

2. The first conditional statement checks if the number is less than or equal to 1. 
If it is, the function immediately returns false because numbers less than or 
equal to 1 are not considered prime.

3. The for loop iterates from 2 to the square root of the given number. 
This loop checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and 
the square root of the number.

4. Within the loop, we use the modulus operator % to check if the number is 
divisible evenly by the current iteration value i. If it is, it means the 
number has a divisor other than 1 and itself, and therefore it is not prime. 
In such cases, the function returns false.

5. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, it means the number is 
only divisible by 1 and itself, which satisfies the criteria for a prime number. 
In such cases, the function returns true.

This solution randomly selects and prints three prime numbers from the numbers 
array using a while loop and the isPrime function.

THE EXPRESSION 'i <= Math.sqrt(number)':

The expression i <= Math.sqrt(number) serves as a condition in the for loop to 
determine the range of values for the variable i during the prime number checking 
process. Specifically, it ensures that the loop iterates up to the square root of 
the given number.

Here's how it functions in finding a prime number:

Initialization: The loop initializes the variable i to 2, representing the potential 
divisors of the number being checked.
Condition: The loop condition i <= Math.sqrt(number) specifies that the loop 
will continue executing as long as the value of i is less than or equal to the 
square root of the given number.

Iteration: In each iteration of the loop, the code inside the loop block is executed.

Divisibility Check: Within the loop, the if statement checks if the number is 
divisible evenly by the current value of i. If the condition number % i === 0 is true, 
it means the number has a divisor other than 1 and itself, and therefore it is not a 
prime number.

Increment: After each iteration, the value of i is incremented by 1 using the 
increment expression i++.

By limiting the iterations of the loop up to the square root of the number, we 
can optimize the prime number checking process. This is because if a number n 
is not a prime, it must have a divisor less than or equal to its square root. 
Therefore, checking divisibility up to the square root is sufficient to determine 
if a number is prime.

For example, if we're checking if 16 is a prime number, the loop will iterate from
2 up to the square root of 16, which is 4. Any potential divisors greater than 4 will
 have corresponding divisors smaller than 4. Therefore, it's unnecessary to check 
 divisibility by numbers greater than the square root.

Overall, the condition i <= Math.sqrt(number) ensures that the loop iterates within 
the appropriate range to check for divisibility and determine if a number is prime.

.............................................................
Second attempt to demistify the prime number finding function
.............................................................

The condition i <= Math.sqrt(number) in the for loop is used to optimize 
the process of finding prime numbers. It helps reduce the number of iterations 
required to determine if a number is prime.

Here's how it works:
The loop iterates from i = 2 up to i <= Math.sqrt(number).
The purpose of Math.sqrt(number) is to calculate the square root of the given number.
This value represents the upper limit for checking divisors.

By iterating up to the square root of the number, we ensure that we cover all 
potential divisors of the number without redundant checks.

If a number n is not prime, it can be factored into two factors, a and b, 
such that n = a * b.
At least one of a or b must be less than or equal to the square root of n. 
If both a and b were greater than the square root of n, their product would 
be greater than n, which is not possible.

Therefore, by checking divisors up to the square root of n, we can effectively 
identify whether a number is prime or not.
As the loop progresses, i is incremented by 1 in each iteration (i++).

By using the condition i <= Math.sqrt(number) in the for loop, we can efficiently 
iterate through potential divisors up to the square root of the number being checked, 
ensuring that we cover all possible divisors without performing unnecessary 
iterations. This optimization improves the performance of the prime number 
checking process.

Exercise 15: Solution and Breakdown
Write a while loop that randomly selects and prints three prime numbers 
from an array of numbers.

const numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20];

let randomIndex;
let randomElement;

while (true) {
  randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * numbers.length);
  randomElement = numbers[randomIndex];
  
  if (isPrime(randomElement)) {
    console.log(randomElement);
  } else {
    break; // Exit the loop when a non-prime number is encountered
  }
}

function isPrime(number) {
  if (number <= 1) {
    return false;
  }

  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(number); i++) {
    if (number % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}


In Exercise 15, the while loop is set to true to create an infinite loop. 
The reason for using an infinite loop is to continue selecting and processing 
prime numbers until a non-prime number is encountered.

Here's an explanation of why while (true) is used:
The condition while (true) creates an infinite loop because the condition true is 
always true. This means the loop will continue executing indefinitely until a break 
statement is encountered or an exception is thrown.

Inside the loop, a random element is selected from the array of numbers. If the 
selected element is prime, it is printed.

Since there is no explicit termination condition in the while loop itself, 
the loop will keep iterating until a non-prime number is encountered. This is 
determined by the conditional check inside the loop.

When a non-prime number is encountered, the break statement is used to exit the 
loop and terminate the execution.

The use of while (true) allows the loop to keep running until a specific condition 
is met, in this case, the condition of encountering a non-prime number. It provides 
flexibility and control over the loop execution, allowing it to continue until the 
desired outcome is achieved before breaking out of the loop.

Exercise 19:
Write a while loop that randomly selects and prints prime numbers from an array 
until the product of the selected prime numbers exceeds a certain limit.
const numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29];
const limit = 1000;

let randomIndex;
let randomElement;
let product = 1;

while (product <= limit) {
  randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * numbers.length);
  randomElement = numbers[randomIndex];
  
  if (isPrime(randomElement)) {
    product *= randomElement;
    console.log(randomElement);
  }
}

function isPrime(number) {
  if (number <= 1) {
    return false;
  }

  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(number); i++) {
    if (number % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}

In this solution:

The array numbers contains a list of prime numbers.
The variable limit represents the maximum product of prime numbers we want to achieve
before terminating the loop.

We initialize the variables randomIndex, randomElement, and product before entering 
the loop.

The loop continues executing as long as the product of the selected prime numbers 
(product) is less than or equal to the limit.

Inside the loop, we generate a random index (randomIndex) using 
Math.floor(Math.random() * numbers.length) and select a random element 
(randomElement) from the numbers array.

We check if the random element is prime by calling the isPrime function. 
If it is, we multiply it with the current product (product *= randomElement) 
and print the element using console.log(randomElement).

The loop will continue until the product exceeds the limit, at which point it 
will terminate.

The isPrime function is the same as the one explained earlier. It checks if a 
given number is prime.

By running this code, the program will randomly select and print prime numbers 
from the numbers array until the product of the selected prime numbers exceeds 
the limit.
..........................
'WHY PRODUCT IS SET TO 1':
..........................
The variable product is initialized to 1 in Exercise 17 because it will be used to 
accumulate the product of the selected prime numbers.

Setting product to 1 is the initial starting point for multiplication. If product 
were initially set to 0, any subsequent multiplication with prime numbers would 
yield a product of 0, regardless of the prime numbers selected.

By setting product to 1, we ensure that when we multiply it with the prime numbers, 
it accurately reflects the actual product of the selected primes. Starting with a 
value of 1 ensures that the product calculation starts from a valid base and can 
correctly accumulate the multiplication of subsequent prime numbers.

During the execution of the loop, the product variable is continuously updated by 
multiplying it with the selected prime numbers using the statement 
product *= randomElement. This multiplication operation allows us to calculate 
the overall product as we iterate through the loop.

Hence, initializing product to 1 ensures that the multiplication correctly captures 
the product of the prime numbers, and it is incremented with each valid prime number 
selected in the loop.
....................................................................................
const numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113];

let randomIndex;
let randomElement;

while (true) {
  randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * numbers.length);
  randomElement = numbers[randomIndex];
  
  if (randomElement > 100) {
    console.log(randomElement);
    break; // Exit the loop when a prime number greater than 100 is encountered
  }
}

In this solution:

The array numbers contains a list of prime numbers.

We initialize the variables randomIndex and randomElement before entering the loop.

The loop continues executing as long as the condition true remains true. This creates
an infinite loop until a break statement is encountered.

Inside the loop, we generate a random index (randomIndex) using 
Math.floor(Math.random() * numbers.length). This index is used to access a random 
element (randomElement) from the numbers array.

We check if the random element is greater than 100. If it is, we print the element 
using console.log(randomElement) and exit the loop using the break statement.

The loop will continue until a prime number greater than 100 is encountered, at 
which point the loop will terminate.

By running this code, the program will continuously select and print prime numbers 
randomly from the numbers array until a prime number greater than 100 is encountered,
at which point the loop will exit.
