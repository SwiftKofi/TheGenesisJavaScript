In each of these exercises, you can use the isPrime function provided 
earlier to check if a number is prime. Additionally, you can modify 
the loop condition and the termination criteria based on the specific 
requirements of each exercise.

WHILE LOOP EXCERCISE
1. Below the cards array, declare a variable, currentCard, with the let keyword 
but don’t assign it a value.
const cards = ['diamond', 'spade', 'heart', 'club'];

2. Create a while loop with a condition that checks if the currentCard does not 
have that value 'spade'. Inside the block of your while loop, add the following 
line of code:

currentCard = cards[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)];
Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) 

will give us a random number from 0 to 3. We’ll use this number to index the 
cards array, and assign the value of currentCard to a random element from 
that array

3. Awesome! Your loop is running, but you can’t tell because it doesn’t output 
anything. Let’s add a console.log() statement to our while block. Inside the block, 
after you assign currentCard a new value, log currentCard to the console.
For fun you can run your code a few times and see how the output changes!

SOLUTION 
let currentCard;

while (currentCard !== 'spade') {
  currentCard = cards[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)];
	console.log(currentCard);
}

QUE1. Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and prints all the numbers 
from 1 to that number using a while loop.

QUE2. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and calculates 
the product of all the numbers using a while loop.

QUE3. Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and prints each character 
of the string in reverse order using a while loop.

QUE4. Write a function that takes an array of strings as a parameter and concatenates 
all the strings into a single string using a while loop.

QUE5. Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and checks if it is a prime
number using a while loop. Return true if it is prime and false otherwise.

QUE6. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and finds the 
smallest number in the array using a while loop.

QUE7. Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and counts the number of 
vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string using a while loop. Return the count.

QUE8. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and calculates 
the average of all the numbers using a while loop.

QUE9. Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and prints a countdown from
that number to 1 using a while loop.

QUE10. Write a function that takes an array of strings as a parameter and finds the 
longest string in the array using a while loop.

QUE12. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and checks if 
there are any negative numbers in the array using a while loop. Return true if there 
are any negative numbers, and false otherwise.
